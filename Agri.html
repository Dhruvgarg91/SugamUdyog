        <h1>Insights</h1>
        <p>The sowing in Rabi is progressing well, with a larger area sown than the previous year, and is expected to
            promote further expansion in the agricultural sector. The Indian agriculture sector is anticipated to grow
            by 3.5 percent in FY 2022–2023, according to fiscal policy declarations. India has recently quickly
            established itself as a net exporter of agricultural goods in addition to satisfying domestic demand.
            Agricultural exports will total $50.2 billion in the fiscal year 2022–2023. Estimates place the nation's
            overall food grain production for the Kharif season at 149.9 million tonnes.
        </p>
        <h1>Industry Scenario</h1>
        <p>In the first nine months of the Financial Year 2022–23 (April–December), exports of agricultural and
            processed food products increased by 13% compared to the same period in FY 2021–22, according to preliminary
            data released by the Directorate General of Commercial Intelligence and Statistics (DGCI&S).</p>
        <br>
        <p>India is both the world's top producer and exporter of cereal-related goods. The export of basmati rice
            climbed from $ 2379 million (April–December 2021) to $ 3337 million (April–December 2022) over the first
            nine months of the fiscal year 2022–23, while the export of non–basmati rice saw an increase of 4% during
            the same period. Exports of non-basmati rice climbed to $ 4663 million in the first nine months of the
            fiscal year 2022–23 from $ 4512 million in the same period the previous year.</p>
