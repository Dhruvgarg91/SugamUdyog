        <h1>Most Used Govt. Schemes</h1>
        <p>The Government of India is implementing initiatives such as Make in India and Atmanirbhar Bharat to boost
            industries and promote domestic manufacturing, aiming to strengthen the economy, create job opportunities,
            and reduce dependence on imports.

            <br>Through policies like GST (Goods and Services Tax) and Ease of Doing Business reforms, the Government of
            India is streamlining processes, reducing bureaucratic hurdles, and fostering a business-friendly
            environment to attract investments, enhance productivity, and propel economic growth.

                    <h3>Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana</h3>
                    <p>The Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana is a refinancing scheme for lending to small and micro
                        enterprises in the manufacturing, trading, or service sector. The loans offered by this scheme
                        are also called MUDRA loans (Micro Units Development Refinance Agency). This MSME scheme
                        provides banks with refinancing facilities against the loans offered to small businesses.</p>

                    <h3>Credit Linked Capital Subsidy </h3>
                    <p>The Credit Linked Capital Subsidy (CLCS) aims to help MSMEs improve their technology to boost
                        revenue generation. Often, MSMEs in rural and semi-urban areas are forced to work with obsolete
                        technologies because they don’t have enough funds to upgrade their machinery. The upper limit
                        for the subsidy is ₹1 crore. The key objective of this MSME scheme is to equip MSMEs with
                        state-of-the-art technology with or without expansion. Khadi, village, and coir industrial units
                        are also included in this MSME finance scheme.</p>

                    <h3>Prime Minister’s Employment Generation Programme </h3>
                    <p>The Prime Minister’s Employment Generation Programme (PMEGP) was introduced by the Khadi and
                        Village Industries Commission (KVIC) to offer financial assistance to new servicing or
                        manufacturing businesses. The MSME funds are in the form of subsidy assistance in the bank.</p>
