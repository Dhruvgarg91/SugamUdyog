                <h1>How to apply for PMMY?
                </h1>
                <p>MSMEs can approach commercial banks, small finance banks, cooperative banks, regional rural banks, and micro finance institutions (MFIs) to apply for MUDRA loans. The applicant has to submit a loan application form along with identity proof, address proof, and business proposal to the bank of their choice. Once the bank approves the loan under the MUDRA scheme, the loan amount is provided through a pre-loaded MUDRA card which is a RuPay debit card. This card will allow borrowers to seamlessly withdraw necessary amounts from an ATM up to ₹25,000 per day.</p>
