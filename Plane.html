        <h1>Insights</h1>
        <p>The aviation industry has benefited from an increasing share of middle-class households, strong competition
            among Low-Cost Carriers, infrastructure development at top airports, and supportive governmental
            environment.
            <br><br>
            In the last three years, the civil aviation sector in India has become one of the
            fastest-growing in the
            nation. It can be broadly divided into three types of services: scheduled air transport, which includes both
            domestic and international airlines; non-scheduled air transport, which includes charter operators and air
            taxi operators; and air cargo service, which includes the delivery of mail and cargo by air.

            <h1>Industry Scenario</h1>
            </h1>
            <p>The rise in demand for air travel in India has necessitated the development of a robust ecosystem and
                supportive government policies.
                <br>The National Civil Aviation Policy 2016 (NCAP) is the government's strategy to increase
                accessibility to flying by lowering costs and boosting connectivity. It supports e-governance,
                deregulation, streamlined processes, and ease of doing business. The Goods and Services Tax on locally
                provided MRO services dropped from 18% to 5% in April 2020. In order for Indian MRO facilities to claim
                zero-rating (i.e., export status) under the GST legislation on MRO services provided to prime
                contractor/OEM situated outside of India, the "place of supply" for B2B MRO services was modified to the
                "location of recipient."This policy change has been tremendously important because it would promote
                international investment in the Indian aviation industry by enabling foreign MRO operators to
                subcontract MRO work to Indian firms without incurring additional tax obligations.
